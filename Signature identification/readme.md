# Problem Statement:
In today's digital world, handwritten signatures play a crucial role in validating the
authenticity of documents and transactions. Manual signature verification, however,
can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, the objective is to
develop a machine-learning model that can automatically verify the authenticity of
handwritten signatures, enabling faster and more accurate signature validation
processes.
